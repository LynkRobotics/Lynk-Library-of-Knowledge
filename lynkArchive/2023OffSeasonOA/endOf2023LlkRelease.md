#### Welcome back to one of (if not) the last 2023 Off-season OA posts of 9496 Lynk! 

In a [previous post](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-9496-lynk-2024-build-thread-open-alliance/441524/8?u=jimmyy), we announced a project called the Lynk Library of Knowledge, or LLK for short. The LLK is a website with a collection of resources for FRC sourced from all over the robotics community. This included Build, Design, Programming, Electrical, Strategy, Business, Technical Binders, Whitepapers, and many more.

The past few months the LLK has grown exponetially, many commits have been made, and has changed shape many times. It has been reorganized, re-themed, sorted, etc many times to find the best way to organize the site. The site's structure as of this release, will be the final structure for the 2024 Season. We won't change it as teams will become familar with the site, and if it did change, that would be very inconvenient for teams to find what they're looking for.  

With that in mind, teams can still contribute to the LLK, in our previous OA post, we setup several custom GitHub Issue templates for "Content Requests."

There are multple issue templates for specific things (such as: CAD, Code Bases, and some more coming soon), but if you have a resource that does not fit those, refer to the "LLK Content Request" GitHub Issue Template. 

todo: Insert an image of the different templates

If you have anything to add, like [CAD models](https://docs.lynkrobotics.org/design/CAD/index.html), [Code Bases](https://docs.lynkrobotics.org/programming/codeBases.html), [Technical Binders](https://docs.lynkrobotics.org/technicalBinders/index.html) feel free to submit it, this site is to help everyone, the more content, the better.
