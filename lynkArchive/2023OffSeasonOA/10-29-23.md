# Training Time! 
Welcome back to the 9496 Lynk OA Thread! This update will be about training our team members for this off-season, and this coming 2024 Crescendo season.

## [Lynk Library of Knowledge (LLK)](https://docs.lynkrobotics.org/) 

### What is the LLK?
The past few weeks, a few of our students and mentors have been putting together a collection of resources from many different teams on a site hosted on GitHub Pages, which will be maintained for years to come. 

### What is contained inside of the LLK?
This site contains different resources about different sub-teams such as Build, Design, Electrical, Programming, Strategy, Scouting, and more. There are even things that are not sub-team specific, such as a section on "What is FRC?" that contains stuff on topics like the history of FRC, what are the different sub-teams, etc.

### How is the LLK sorted?
These resources range from the absolute basics to advanced topics, and so the LLK is separated into three tiers: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. These tiers were decided on so that when the LLK expanded with a lot of different resources, navigating through it wouldn't become confusing and overwhelming to see a gigantic list of resources with no topic in mind. 

### Why is the LLK? 
With the coming season approaching very rapidly, giving us little time to create original training content, we realized that you don't need to reinvent the wheel. With so many resources that already exist out in the wild, there is little to no point to make (for example) an intro to Java slideshow when there are 30 of them out there. We hope to also help other teams out there with this, as one of the Open Alliance values is "Open Alliance teams join to help everyone - not just other Open Alliance teams." We hope that this helps all teams out there in the FRC community. 

### Can I contribute to the LLK? 
Yes, you can. As stated before, there are a lot of resources out there in the wild, and it would be amazing for the LLK to grow more than it already has for years to come. 

#### How can I contribute?
You can submit a "Content Request" by going and submitting one in our GitHub issues found [here](https://github.com/LynkRobotics/Lynk-Library-of-Knowledge/issues/new/choose). There is an issue template there that tells you all the information you need to provide for a "Content Request."
