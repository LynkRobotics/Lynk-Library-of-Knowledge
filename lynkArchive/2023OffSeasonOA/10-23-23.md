## First (actual) Team Meeting
On 10/23/2023, we hosted our first actual team meeting (besides the interest meeting prior); the purpose of this meeting was to meet our future teammates, discover available roles within the team, and see a competitive FRC robot in action. 


### An actual robot? but how?!
An FRC robot that has competed before? Where did we get that? Well, a huge thanks to fellow North Carolina Open Alliance Team, 3506 YETI Robotics, from Charlotte, NC! They were kind enough to lend us their 2023 competition robot to showcase to the students different parts and pieces that go into a robot and how everyone has their role within an FRC team.

As our mentors went through the different sub-teams, such as build, electrical, programming, design, business, awards, media, fundraising, etc. The students were ecstatic to learn more.

We ran through in detail what kickoff is like, what the build season is like, the different competition positions, like drive team, pit crew, awards team, and scouting is like. 

Overall, the students are excited for this pre-season, and the incoming 2024 Crescendo season.
