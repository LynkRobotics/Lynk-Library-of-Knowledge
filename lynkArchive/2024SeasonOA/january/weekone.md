"What Not How" <br>
On the early days of a kickoff we are trying to gain an understanding of what the game will be, at this point we don't care how a robot will do something but rather what it will choose to do in a match and why. So are main focus in the early days was trying to break down the match scoring and strategy so we could make sure that we have a solid understanding of the game and why we may want to do one task over another.

A big part of these early discussions is unanswered questions throughout the early days we kept a list of questions we had that students were working on answering or preparing for Q&A if they couldn't find an answer. And at the end of the day the answers that we found were presented to the team.

We want to give a huge thank you to Fountain Electric and Services for being a founding investor in our team and presenting their donation at kickoff. This set a great tone to backdrop our kickoff, and we appreciated the kinds words from Terry Fountain. <br>

Also we got pizza as all things should be on kickoff <br>

By this time we had gained a solid understanding of what could happen in a match so we started working on a list of every legal function a robot could do. The goal with this is to help capture odd features and create the list that we will later pull from to create the Our Robot Will list. This is a great opportunity to have a discussion about odd or possibly illegal strategies and can be a great time for brainstorming.

By this point we have been discussing strategy and what robots might do for several days we also created a list of potential robot archetypes that we expect to see all in an effort to better understand the coming season but we haven't even started on what we will do. So this is the day we finally got to this. We worked on this in the form of a "Our Robot Will" list, this is a list of functions that we will try to achieve with our robot, it doesn't answer how but rather what. We also tried to make this goals measurable so we will actually know when we have achieved them. This list will be a work in progress for the next few days but at some point it will become are guide through the build season that we will rely on when we are designing our robot.

We got our tool cart today so we can finally organize our tools and start setting those standards.

And last but not least for this day we built and AMP so we will have it at hand once we start prototyping.

Todays main goal was to polish the "Our Robot Will" list and get this in a form that we were willing to hold to for the season. Once we finished this we finally were able to start talking about the How of our robot.  <br>

At this point we know what we want our robot to do we just need to look at how. Similar to how we came to the list of what our robot will do we start by listing every way we think a robot could do these task. And at this point there is no such thing as a bad idea,  we want all the ideas even if they don't make sense as those can sometime lead to great ideas.

Also business side worked on nailing down the investor levels and what benefits those may entail. <br>

We had an online class to work on chassis design and created this assembly of a swerve drive chassis with cross rails and a belly pan. The model was made in such a way that it is very easy to adjust the size of the chassis so once we choose the dimensions it will only take a few seconds to type it in and we can start cutting the tubes to length. <br>
