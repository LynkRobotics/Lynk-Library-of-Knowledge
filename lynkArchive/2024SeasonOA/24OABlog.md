# Hello Open Alliance!
Welcome to Team 9496 Lynk's 2024 OA thread! We are a community based rookie team (first year as a team, and first year as an Open Alliance team).

## About Us 
Lynk is a newly formed high school FIRST Robotic Competition (FRC) team, operating under the umbrella of the Inspire Carolina, Inc non-profit organization. We believe that FRC is a powerful program that can challenge and grow the high school students in our region, and have a positive impact on our community. We're a community team based out of Rutherford County North Carolina, serving the whole region and we're welcoming to all students who are in 9-12 grade (14-18 years old).


## 2024 Events?
Currently we are planning to be in attendance of are: 
- FNC District UNC Asheville Event
- FNC District Mecklenburg County Event

### Open Alliance Thread
This off-season, we hope to push at least 1 update every 2-3 weeks. During the season, we hope to push an update at least once a week minimum if not more. We are excited to join the OA community, and interact with everyone :)
