# if, else if, else

<br>

- `if` statements let us control the flow of the program. 
    - They allow some parts of the program to execute while preventing other parts of the program from executing based on boolean logic.

## Example

````java
if (x == y){  //"if" statements decide to do something based on if something is true or false.
            System.out.println("x equals y");
        } else if (x > y){ //"else if" allows us to check another statement if the first statement was false                            
            System.out.println("x greater than y");
        } else { //"else" lets us to do things when the if statement is false
            System.out.println("x less than y");
        }
````
