# Basic Math

- The `=` in programming is the assignment operator.
  - It tells the program to assign a value to a variable.
  - The variable on the left is now equal to what is on the right.
  - `10 = x` , won’t work because you can’t store `x` inside of `10` 
- Basic math can be performed on variables.
  - In this program `x` and `y` are added together with `+` and stored in `answer`, but you can also
    - Subtract with `-`
    - Multiple with `*`
    - Divide with `/` 
      - Remember `int` variables don’t have decimal values
    - `+`,`-`,`*`, & `/` are all called operators

## Example

int y = 20;
