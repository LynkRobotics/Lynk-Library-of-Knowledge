# Variables

<br>

- Variables are used to store information in a program and allow us to access that information or modify it.
  - You can think of them like variables in algebra. 
- Variables should be named to easily identify what they represent. 
  - Like in this example the variable answer is the answer to the equation.
- There are different types of variables
  - The three variables in this program are `int`, short for integer, type variables.
  - `int` variables can only store whole numbers, they canâ€™t have decimal points.
