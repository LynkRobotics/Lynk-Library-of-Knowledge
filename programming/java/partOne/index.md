<br>

Welcome to the beginner Java tutorial, this is the landing page for part one. I ask if you are new to programming and/or Java for that matter, please go in order to reduce possible confusion.

## Preface

<br>

In this part you will learn about the pure basics of Java.
We will be using this block of Java code for this part. 

````java
//Anything typed after a "//" is comment, the complier ignores comments
//Comments are used to provide more information about what a program is doing.

public class JavaIntro {                        //This creates the "class", for now think of each class like a document or file
    public static void main(String args[]) {    //This line lets Java know what to run when you click execute below
      int x = 10;
      int y = 20;
      int answer = x + y;

      System.out.println("Answer: " + answer);
    }                                           //End of main
}                                               //End of JavaIntro
