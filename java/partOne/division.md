## Example

````Java
//Anything typed after a "//" is comment, the complier ignores comments
//Comments are used to provide more information about what a program is doing.

public class JavaIntro {                        //This creates the "class", for now think of each class like a document or file
    public static void main(String args[]) {    //This line lets Java know what to run when you click execute below
      int x = 10;
      int y = 20;
      int answer = x / y;

      System.out.println("Answer: " + answer);
    }                                           //End of main
}                                               //End of JavaIntro
````
<br>

`Output: 0`

<br>

Since int canâ€™t have decimals, the answer is 0 instead of 0.5
