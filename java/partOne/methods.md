## ````System.out.println()````

- In java this is known as a method
  - methods are also called functions in other programming languages
  - Methods are code that perform a specific task
  - We can send variables to methods and methods can send information back as well.
- This specific method allows us to output text for us to read.
  - The text is in quotation marks so Java knows that itâ€™s text and not variables or methods.
  - We use the `+` to tell java to append the value of our `answer` variable to the end
