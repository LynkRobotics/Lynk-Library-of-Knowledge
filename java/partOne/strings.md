# Strings

<br>

***

<br>

- A `String` in java is like a variable that stores text.
- We can create a `String` named `text` and store `“Answer: “` inside of it. 
- We can then use it in future methods just like our other variables.

## Example

<br> 

````Java
//Anything typed after a "//" is comment, the complier ignores comments
//Comments are used to provide more information about what a program is doing.

public class JavaIntro {                        //This creates the "class", for now think of each class like a document or file
    public static void main(String args[]) {    //This line lets Java know what to run when you click execute below
      double x = 10;
      double y = 20;
      double answer = x / y;
      String text = "Answer: ";

      System.out.println(text + answer);
    }                                           //End of main
}                                               //End of JavaIntro
